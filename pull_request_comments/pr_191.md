The Site CI failure is still caused by an unresolved ESLint react/no-unescaped-entities error in site/src/components/WaveCards.tsx at line 85, column 72.

Although multiple commits have been made, none of the existing commits modify the JSX text at this exact location. As a result, the same lint error is re-triggering on every CI run.

Please do the following on the existing branch associated with this PR (do not open a new PR and do not refactor logic):
	1.	Open site/src/components/WaveCards.tsx.
	2.	Navigate to line ~85 and locate the JSX text content causing the lint error.
	3.	Identify any raw backticks (`) or apostrophe-like characters within JSX text.
	4.	Replace those characters with proper HTML entities (for example:
 ` → &grave;
 ' → &apos;
or restructure the string to avoid the character entirely.
	5.	Do not change component behavior, layout, data flow, or logic — this is a lint-only text fix.
	6.	Commit the change directly to the current branch tied to this PR.
	7.	After the commit is pushed, re-run Site CI / build.
Once the JSX text at line 85 is corrected, ESLint should pass and the CI pipeline should go green. No additional changes should be required.
