# 🔒 Fallback Checkpoint — Intraday Alpha Live (2026-01-26)

## Purpose
This repository state is a **canonical fallback checkpoint** representing a verified, fully working system with:

- Correct intraday return (`return_1d`) computation
- Live snapshot generation
- Functional alpha attribution and UI display
- Coordinated data + app + analytics behavior

This fallback exists to guarantee a safe restore point if future development introduces regressions.

## Covered Scope
This fallback includes, as-is:

- `scripts/generate_live_snapshot_csv.py`  
  (explicit intraday `return_1d` logic verified)
- `app_min.py` (current working UI)
- `data/live_snapshot.csv` as generated by this logic
- All supporting helpers and workflows in their current state

No files were truncated or refactored.

## Restore Instructions
To restore this fallback exactly:

```bash
git checkout fallback/intraday-alpha-live-2026-01-26
```
