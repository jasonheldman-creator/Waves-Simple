The Decision Ledger provides governance accountability.

Every portfolio decision—entry, exit, rebalance—is logged with timestamp, wave identifier, and rationale. Every alpha contract—the expected return profile and risk parameters—is recorded at inception.

The Ledger tracks outcome reconciliation. Did the wave deliver on its contract? If not, why not? Was it regime conditions? Execution friction? Strategy drift?

This creates an immutable audit trail. Oversight committees can trace any current position back to its original decision rationale. No black boxes. No memory gaps.

The Ledger also supports performance attribution at the decision level. You can see which decisions contributed to returns and which detracted, with full transparency.

This is governance-native design. It treats compliance, transparency, and oversight as first-class requirements, not afterthoughts.
