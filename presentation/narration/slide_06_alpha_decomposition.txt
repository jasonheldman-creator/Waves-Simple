Here's how it works in practice.

Imagine a Wave delivers eight percent total excess return over its benchmark. Vector Truth decomposes this into:

Security selection alpha of five percent—the exposure-adjusted return from strategic positioning.

Exposure management alpha of two percent—gains from timing and scaling decisions.

Capital preservation effect of one and a half percent—the structural benefit from VIX overlays and regime-aware cash sweeps.

And a benchmark construction offset of negative point five percent—the expected structural drag from benchmark composition choices.

Notice how the structural components largely offset. That's intentional. The residual strategy return of seven point five percent is what's truly alpha-eligible after governance controls.

Vector Truth provides this breakdown with full regime attribution, showing how much alpha was earned in risk-on versus risk-off environments. This tells you whether the strategy is durable across market conditions.
