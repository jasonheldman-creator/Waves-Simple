The Performance Deep Dive console provides real-time visibility into every Wave.

You see historical return charts with regime overlays—shaded regions indicating risk-on versus risk-off periods.

You see rolling alpha metrics, drawdown analysis, and volatility tracking, all benchmarked against governed composite indices.

The system highlights synthetic data with clear visual indicators. No one is misled. If a Wave is using placeholder data while real market integration is in progress, you'll know immediately.

The WaveScore system provides a proprietary performance scoring algorithm that combines return magnitude, consistency, regime balance, and risk efficiency into a single digestible metric.

Every chart, every table, every metric is exportable. CSV downloads, PDF board packs, institutional-ready formatting. No manual data wrangling required.
