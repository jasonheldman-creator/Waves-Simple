Implementation is designed for minimal friction.

WAVES Intelligence supports multiple data integration pathways. You can connect via CSV file uploads, API endpoints for real-time market data, or leverage our synthetic data seeding for immediate onboarding.

The system is built on Python and Streamlit, with deployment via Vercel for instant cloud availability. No complex infrastructure. No vendor lock-in.

The data pipeline is idempotent and transactional. You can run data updates multiple times safely. Backups are automatic. Rollback is straightforward.

For institutions with existing data warehouses, we provide schema documentation and migration scripts. The Wave ID registry is extensible—add new Waves, define custom benchmarks, configure attribution rules.

Our implementation team works with your data governance and compliance teams to ensure WAVES Intelligence meets your specific institutional requirements.
