Regime attribution is essential for assessing durability.

Vector Truth tracks every return period's market regime—risk-on or risk-off—based on VIX levels and volatility signals.

We then show cumulative alpha earned in each regime. If a strategy delivers four percent alpha in risk-on and three percent in risk-off, that's balanced. It suggests resilience.

But if a strategy shows six percent alpha in risk-on and negative one percent in risk-off, that's a red flag. The strategy is regime-dependent. Its durability is questionable.

We calculate a fragility score from zero to one. Low fragility means the alpha is structurally sound. High fragility means it's vulnerable to regime shifts, dispersion collapse, or volatility suppression.

Boards need to know this. Traditional attribution hides it. Vector Truth surfaces it explicitly.
