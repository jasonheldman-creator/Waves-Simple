Mission Control is your real-time risk monitoring hub.

It displays current VIX levels, regime classifications, and exposure adjustments across all Waves.

The VIX Regime Overlay system automatically classifies market conditions as risk-on or risk-off based on trailing volatility. When regimes shift, Mission Control highlights which Waves are affected and how exposure levels adjust.

The SmartSafe gating system is visible here. When volatility spikes above critical thresholds, capital preservation overlays activate. You see this in real time. No surprises.

Mission Control also tracks capital deployment across Waves, identifies concentration risks, and monitors benchmark drift. If a governed benchmark is drifting from its snapshot definition, you're alerted immediately.

This is proactive risk management. Not reactive firefighting.
