WAVES Intelligence generates comprehensive PDF board packs automatically.

Each board pack includes an executive summary, wave-by-wave performance analysis, Vector Truth attribution reports, and Decision Ledger highlights.

The system uses deterministic narrative templates. The language is stable, predictable, and governance-appropriate. No marketing fluff. No predictive claims. Just clear, factual reporting.

The board packs integrate seamlessly with existing reporting workflows. They're designed for quarterly board meetings, investment committee reviews, and regulatory filings.

Institutions can customize branding, adjust content sections, and control disclosure levels. But the underlying analytics remain deterministic and auditable.

This isn't just automation. It's institutional-grade documentation at scale.
