WAVES Intelligence provides four integrated capabilities:

First, Alpha Attribution—our Vector Truth Layer decomposes returns into structural effects and residual strategy returns, with complete regime awareness.

Second, Performance Deep Dive—comprehensive wave performance charts, metrics, and historical tracking with synthetic data support for seamless onboarding.

Third, Decision Ledger—a governance layer that tracks every decision, contract, and oversight action, creating an immutable audit trail.

And fourth, Board-Ready Reporting—institutional PDF board packs that translate complex analytics into clear, actionable narratives.

Each component is built on the Wave ID system, our canonical identifier framework that ensures data integrity across all analytics.
