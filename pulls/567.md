# Enable runtime-gated live data capability for PRICE_BOOK

This PR resolves a runtime environment gating issue that prevented live-capable execution in Streamlit Cloud.

The PRICE_BOOK architecture remains cache-first and deterministic. No implicit network fetching was introduced.

## Key Changes:
- Unified runtime gating via the LIVE_DATA_ENABLED environment variable
- Ensured Streamlit Cloud rebuilds reflect environment changes
- Preserved explicit-only fetch semantics for cache rebuilds
- Maintained the canonical cache (prices_cache.parquet) as the single source of truth

## Validation:
- Screenshot A: baseline render
- Screenshot B: subsequent execution with updated UTC timestamp and Git SHA, confirming live-capable runtime

## Scope:
- No changes to snapshot mechanics
- No implicit API calls
- No architectural refactor beyond environment gating
