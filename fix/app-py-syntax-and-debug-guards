This PR hardens app.py against Streamlit parser and runtime failures caused by
unsafe sidebar info banners, duplicate imports, and debug-mode side effects.

Key changes and intent:

- Remove or avoid f-strings inside st.sidebar.info calls.
- Ensure all sidebar info messages are single-line, literal strings.
- Prevent multiline or dynamically formatted sidebar banners that can trigger
  SyntaxError or unterminated string parsing issues in Streamlit Cloud.
- Confirm only a single `import streamlit as st` exists.
- Ensure DEBUG / diagnostics modes are disabled by default.

This is a preventative stabilization and hardening pass.
No functional logic, calculations, or strategy behavior is changed.

This PR exists to improve deployment reliability and reduce Streamlit runtime
parser failures observed during recent merges.
